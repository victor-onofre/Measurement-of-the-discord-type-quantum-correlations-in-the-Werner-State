# Measurement of the discord-type quantum correlations in the Werner State

A program that I used for my master's degree thesis. Rendered version in nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/victor-onofre/Measurement-of-the-discord-type-quantum-correlations-in-the-Werner-State/blob/main/Quantum_Correlations_of_The_Werner_State.ipynb).

I compute the local quantum uncertainty and quantum Fisher information to measure the discord-type quantum correlations of the Werner state. I compare the results to the concurrence (a measure of entanglement) of the system.
